Benchmarking of protein interaction databases for integration with manually reconstructed signaling network models Van de Graaf et al

Initial setup for the model Netflux is required for this model to run. Download netflux files from https://github.com/saucermanlab/Netflux

The included files should be downloaded together to run effectively as written. MATLAB R2022a, Python 3.9 (using Spyder 3.7.9), and RStudio version 1.4.1717 were used to run the included code.

The figures from the manuscript can be remade using the associated code as listed below:
